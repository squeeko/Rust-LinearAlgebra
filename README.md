# Rust-LinearAlgebra

This repo is created as a refresher of Linear Algebra for Data Science BUT using Rust. This work is based on the following book 
“Practical Linear Algebra for Data Science by Mike X. Cohen (O’Reilly).
Copyright 2022 Syncxpress BV, 978-1-098-12061-0.”

I am using Rust to code the examples in this book that are originally written in Python, so it is actaully ported to Rust from Python.

Thank you all and I hope others can benefit from my effort.
